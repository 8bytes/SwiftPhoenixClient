SwiftPhoenixChannels
====================

Phoenix Socket Client in Swift (WIP)

Breaking Changes!

There were significant changed in the most recent version of Phoenix Channels as well as breaking changes in Swift 1.2. Because of this, I am in the process of completely rewriting the library to match the Phoenix docs as closely as possible. Hopefully this will help developers interact with both codebases more easily. 

Sorry for any issues this causes :)

## Note:

Currently works with Swift 1.2, Xcode 6.4, and Phoenix 0.17.

Tested with the [Phoenix Chat Server example](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example) at commit [8c8c4bd](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example/commit/8c8c4bd265e0519077344c942fb870a15aaac7d0) at a point where it was working with Phoenix 0.17.
