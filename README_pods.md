## NOTE: Development Usage

Create a `Podfile` in a new Xcode project (MyProject), containing:
````
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'SwiftPhoenixClient', :path => '~/your/local/path/to/SwiftPhoenixClient'
````

Then run the CocoaPod install inside your new Xcode project:
````
$ cd MyProject
$ pod install
````

Alternatively, for the impatient, you can run the example project in the SwiftPhoenixClient repo. You don't need your own project to see this working.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

SwiftPhoenixClient is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwiftPhoenixClient"
```
